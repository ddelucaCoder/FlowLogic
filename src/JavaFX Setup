How To Setup JavaFX:
(There may be a better way to do all this, this way worked for me and can be changed to be made easier in the future)
Step 1: Ensure You are using Java 17
This can be done if you go to File -> Project Structure -> Project. The SDK should say Java 17

Step 2: Add jar files to module (Potentially Not Needed)
To do this simply go to File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Dependencies
Click on the plus arrow and select JARs
Go into this project file -> lib -> javafx-sdk-17.0.14 -> lib and select all the .jar files then click apply

Step 3:
Go to Run -> Edit Configurations -> Plus Arrow -> Application
Set Main class to UserInterface
Select Modify Options
Add VM options
and add this string "--module-path "lib/javafx-sdk-17.0.14/lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
Click apply.


To test if it worked try running the UserInterface main and seeing if a menu pop's up.
